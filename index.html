          <h1>The importance of minification and compression</h1>
          <time datetime="0001-01-01 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">0001-01-01 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC</time>

        <p>Over the holidays I’ve been working on a small project playing with some of the new Javascript libraries that came out over the past year. After a while I noticed that the size of the Javascript I was sending to the client was growing and starting to approach 100 KB for a basic isomorphic website. I figured now was a good time to look into minification and compression.</p>

<p>The site starts out by loading in the following raw code:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Riot.js</th>
<th>64KB</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Page.js</td>
<td>14KB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>client code</td>
<td>14KB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>92KB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>After Browserify was done rolling all of the code up into a single file it was ~92KB which was getting a little large for a website which basically did nothing. First step was to add minification to the Makefile using <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2">UglifyJs2</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-make">$(CLIENT_MIN_ROLLUP): $(CLIENT_ROLLUP)
	$(UGLIFYJS) --screw-ie8 $^ -o $@
</code></pre>

<p>This step brought it down from 92KB to 44KB shaving off over 50% of the original size. This is still quite a lot of code for such a simple site so the next step is to add gzip compression for everything being sent. I am using <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">expressjs 4.0</a> as the webserver so to add gzip it’s as easy as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">import compression from 'compression';
app.use(compression());
</code></pre>

<p>After adding gzip the data sent over the wire went down to an impressive 14KB. That’s only 15% of the original size, a savings of 78KB for a total of about 2 minutes worth of work. This really shows that no matter the size of your website the cost/bennefit of implementing even basic minification and compression is well worth it.

          <h1>Automatically build files when they change with Make</h1>
          <time datetime="0001-01-01 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">0001-01-01 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC</time>

        <p>When writing code which needs to be built before it can be used, whether that’s a transpile step like ES7 JavaScript to ES5, or a compile step like with Go, you’re likely going to want to do this when a file in your application tree is modified. There are a large number of project and language specific tools which were developed to tackle this problem but did you know that there are system level packages available that you can use across all your projects?</p>

<p>Introducing <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/inotifywait">inotifywait</a>, which is an efficient and easy to use cli tool which uses Linux’s inotify interface to watch for changes to the file system. And <a href="http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/">fswatch</a> for those on OSX. Most of the language and project specific tools are built using wrappers around these two tools.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and don’t like to add more build tools and layers of abstraction than necessary then you’re probably already using Make to build and develop your application, and you’ll be happy to know that using these tools with it is trivial. Make has no way to know when a file has changed until the next time you run make so because of this many have tried something like the following which will run the build target every 2s.</p>

<pre><code>watch -n 2 make build
</code></pre>

<p>Or they will build the loop into the makefile.</p>

<pre><code class="language-make">.PHONY watch
watch:
  while true; do \
    make build --silent; \
    sleep 1; \
  done
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but it’s performing a lot of unneccesary work being run in a loop especially since the file system is able to tell us when a file or directory has been modified using inotify. Instead of automatically looping we wait for a file system event that we’re interested in and then run our build target. In the following code we’re able to create a make target in our makefile which will watch for file changes under our specified directory recursively.</p>

<pre><code class="language-make">.PHONY watch
watch:
  while true; do \
    inotifywait -qr -e modify -e create -e delete -e move app/src; \
    make build; \
  done
</code></pre>

<p>This works by creating an infinite loop which is started when you run the watch target. Before the first loop can finish it hits inotifywait which sets up listeners on all of the files and directories in your app/src directory. These listeners are waiting for any files to be modified, created, deleted, or moved in or out of app/src/…. When a file or directory changes inotifywait lets the loop continue triggering the call to your build target. That target executes in its entirety building only the file(s) which changed (assuming you’ve properly set up your makefile) and then the loop starts again with inotifywait waiting for those files to change again.</p>

<p>Using this technique will allow you to create an easy and efficient file change watcher for your makefile without too many additional tools.

          <h1>Using Juju for development</h1>
          <time datetime="0001-01-01 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">0001-01-01 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC</time>

<p>Juju works great for software development involving simple environments and is amazing for complex environments. A recent question on Ask Ubuntu <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/635758/is-juju-a-suitable-tool-for-development-as-well-as-deployment">“Is Juju a suitable tool for development as well as deployment?”</a> made me realize that we use Juju for development every day but there really isn’t much documentation on the subject.</p>

<p>For the rest of this post I’m going to assume that you are already familiar with the concept of Juju and what problems it solves on the deployment side of things. If you aren’t, I recommend reading an earlier post of mine <a href="http://fromanegg.com/post/97035773367/juju-explain-it-to-me-like-im-5">“Juju - Explain it to me like I’m 5”</a>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems when developing any kind of software is getting the dependencies up and running in a way which matches the production environment close enough to be sure that you aren’t going to run into “this environment only” bugs. Sure you can install mysql onto your local machine and run the database dump on that install, but you also have to make sure that you apply all of the same configuration, indexes, build flags, etc. as the production environment.</p>

<p>Even once you get it up and running you then need the ability to update it after modifications were made by someone else on the project all with high production parity, and without extraneous downtime.</p>

<p>To illustrate the benefits of using Juju for development I’m going to use a fictitious photo and video sharing website. A website like this would require multiple services, load balancer, web server, database, blob store, user authentication, photo processor, video processor.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that a Juju Charm can be written using any programming language or DSL that can be executed on the host machine. This means it can use Puppet, Chef, Python, JavaScript, Docker, and pretty much anything else you would like to use. Juju provides distinct advantages for project development depending on the lifecycle of the project. For our photo video site let’s first assume that we’re just starting the project and then later on we’ll assume that the project is mature, released, and still under active development.</p>

<h4 id="just-starting-out">Just starting out</h4>

<p>Typically when a project starts you’re only going to need a couple services, the database and your webserver. Let’s start our environment and install the database and webserver on our local machine.</p>

<pre><code>juju bootstrap local
juju deploy apache2
juju deploy mongodb
</code></pre>

<p>Great, It’s 5 minutes in and we now have apache2 and mongodb running on our machine in separate LXC’s, we can now start developing our website and pointing it to these services.</p>

<p>Parallel to this, your teammate is working on the user authentication service, it’s going well and they want someone to help them test it in the application environment. So lets get that service that they have been working on.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/charms/trusty &amp;&amp; cd ~/charms/trusty
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:photovideo/authenticator
juju deploy --repository=. local:trusty/authenticator
</code></pre>

<p><em>For more information on deploying local charms see <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/568137/how-to-deploy-juju-charm-in-development-branch/568174#568174">This Post</a> on Ask Ubuntu.</em></p>

<p>A few minutes later and you have an identical copy to their user authenticator service, you can point your website to it and give it a try. A little later the authenticator service has been updated and you’d like to run it again.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/charms/trusty/authenticator
git pull
juju upgrade-charm --repository=.
</code></pre>

<p>This process repeats itself throughout each service and across each member of your team. Allowing each one to update their dependencies within minutes to identical representations of how it’ll be run in production.</p>

<h4 id="released-project">Released project</h4>

<p>Now that your project has been released, deployed using Juju, running in production, you’ve had a chance to take advantage of Juju’s deployment and scaling features but how does Juju help you develop now?</p>

<p>In some ways it’s even easier to deploy. In this case, I’m going to assume that your services are private and not stored in the <a href="https://jujucharms.com">Juju Charm Store</a>. If they were in there you wouldn’t have to first clone the repositories.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/charms/trusty &amp;&amp; cd ~/charms/trusty
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:photovideo/mongodb
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:photovideo/authenticator
…

juju-quickstart -e local photovideo.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Taking advantage of Juju Quickstart and the Juju bundles functionality you can deploy your entire environment with identical services, configuration, and machine placements. This will open up the GUI which will allow you to modify the machine placement of any of those services and change configuration values before deploying to your machine. Once you hit commit, sit back and wait for it to deploy an identical environment to your production environment on your local machine.</p>

<p>Now you can work on the specific service you’re interested in within an identical environment to everyone on your team. And when a service gets updated by another member on your team it’s trivial to update.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/charms/trusty/authenticator
git pull
juju upgrade-charm --repository=.
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this gets you excited to use Juju for development as well as deployment. My team uses Juju for development this way and has for over a year. It allows us to be more productive because we don’t have to waste time installing and updating services the hard way.</p>

<p>I’ll be creating a follow-up to this post with real code examples and workflows for doing the actual development of these services, stay tuned!
