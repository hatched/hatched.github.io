      <description>This multi-part series will take you through everything from how to get a basic Node.js static file server going, to different way’s to deliver the content to the user, common pitfalls, caching, and when to use Node.js to serve files vs other solutions.
I’m going to assume you already have Node.js up running on your computer and that you know javascript. This code was developed on v0.6.1-pre and I will make an effort to update it and the version number as things change with Node.</description>
