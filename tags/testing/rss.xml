      <description>Whenever you write any code that is to be consumed by another, whether it be a library or some UI element, that consumer expects it to work in a certain way every time they interact with it. All good developers would agree and that’s why we also write tests that either break our code up into chunks and test that each chunk works as expected, unit tests, or test the entire lifecycle, end to end tests.</description>

      <description>A number of people, myself included, have a hard time getting started with test driven development (TDD). The issue lies in that it’s difficult to wrap your head around something that is rather non specific in its implementation and it is usually described as “writing your tests before you write your code”.
When developers hear “Write your tests before you write your code”, then they look at their previous test suite they wonder… “How can I possibly write this without having written the code first?</description>
