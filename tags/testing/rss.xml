      <description>A number of people, myself included, have a hard time getting started with test driven development (TDD). The issue lies in that it’s difficult to wrap your head around something that is rather non specific in its implementation and it is usually described as “writing your tests before you write your code”.
When developers hear “Write your tests before you write your code”, then they look at their previous test suite they wonder… “How can I possibly write this without having written the code first?</description>
