      <description>Do you have a new Android phone and cannot transfer files to OSX using the Android File Transfer Tool because you keep getting the error “Could not replace file, could not copy file .” ?
The fix for me was to make sure that the phone was unlocked and the screen on on the homescreen.
Hope this helps anyone else running into this error. Do you have another solution? Let me know and I’ll add it here for others.</description>
