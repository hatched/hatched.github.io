      <description>If you find yourself needing to run Linux-only-software for development of some kind but would prefer to work in the host OSX operating system for whatever reason instead of the VM then this guide is for you.
At the time of writing I am using OSX 10.7.5 and Ubuntu 12.04 [Update: Also works with OSX 10.7.5 and Ubuntu 13.04, OSX 10.10.5 and Ubuntu 14.04] inside of a Parallels 8.0 VM. But as long as the host and VM have IP’s assigned then you shouldn’t have any huge issues.</description>
